        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>With the massive oversaturation of brands trying to sell stuff, more and more people are turning to
             purpose-driven companies. That's where the About page comes into it; it should capture the story of what drove the founders to do what they do.
             So if an e-comm brand didn't have an "about us", I'd be surprised if they manage to sell anything. 
             Most companies now are all playing into that "we're two mum's who saw that regular toothpaste just wasn't cutting it,
              so we blah blah blah." space. Guess it works.</p>
